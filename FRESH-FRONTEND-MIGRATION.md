## Technical Highlights

### Architecture

**Framework**: Fresh 1.7.3 (Deno's web framework)
- **Islands Architecture** - Only interactive components ship JS
- **Server-Side Rendering** - Fast initial page loads
- **File-Based Routing** - Automatic route generation
- **Zero Build Step** - No webpack/vite needed

**Type Safety**:
- Full TypeScript coverage
- Shared types between frontend and backend
- Type-safe API calls

**Performance**:
- Server-rendered pages: <100ms
- Minimal JavaScript bundle
- Progressive enhancement

### API Integration

All pages fetch data from:
1. **API Gateway** (port 8080) - Teams, players, games, umpires
2. **Data Fetcher** (port 8082) - Metrics and status

**Error Handling**:
- Graceful fallbacks on API errors
- Empty state messages
- Console error logging

### Styling

**Tailwind CSS** (built-in with Fresh):
- Responsive grid layouts
- Color-coded status badges
- Hover effects
- Mobile-friendly

   - Umpire scorecards
   - Historical accuracy

### Phase 2: Interactive Islands

Add client-side interactivity:
- `islands/SearchBar.tsx` - Live search suggestions
- `islands/StatsChart.tsx` - Interactive charts (Recharts)
- `islands/GameSimulation.tsx` - Live simulation updates
- `islands/PlayerComparison.tsx` - Compare players

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

## Environment Variables

**Development** (defaults):
```bash
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/v1
DATA_FETCHER_URL=http://localhost:8082
```

**Docker Compose** (internal network):
```bash
API_BASE_URL=http://api-gateway:8080/api/v1
DATA_FETCHER_URL=http://data-fetcher:8082
```

**Production**:
```bash
API_BASE_URL=https://api.baseball-sim.com/api/v1
DATA_FETCHER_URL=https://data.baseball-sim.com
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### API Connection Issues

**Symptom**: Pages show "No data found"

**Solutions**:
1. Check backend services: `docker-compose ps`
2. Test API: `curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health`
3. Check environment variables in docker-compose.yml
4. Check CORS settings in API Gateway

### Build Errors

**Symptom**: Docker build fails

**Solutions**:
1. Clear Docker cache: `docker builder prune`
2. Update Deno version in Dockerfile
3. Check deno.json imports are valid

### Port Conflicts

**Symptom**: Port 8000 already in use

**Solutions**:
1. Change port in docker-compose.yml: `"3000:8000"`
2. Or kill process: `lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9`
