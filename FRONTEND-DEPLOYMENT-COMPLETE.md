## Access Information

### Local Development
```bash
# View logs
docker-compose logs -f frontend

# Restart frontend
docker-compose restart frontend

# Rebuild frontend
docker-compose up -d --build frontend

# Stop frontend
docker-compose stop frontend
```

### URLs
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **API Gateway**: http://localhost:8080
- **Data Fetcher**: http://localhost:8082
- **Metrics**: http://localhost:3000/metrics

## Known Issues & Notes

### Fixed Issues ✅
- ✅ Search API null pointer errors (fixed with optional chaining)
- ✅ Docker build configuration
- ✅ Port mapping (3000 → 8000)

### Notes
- Search returns empty array `[]` when no results (expected behavior)
- Some backend data may be incomplete depending on data fetch status
- Old React frontend archived but not deleted (safe to remove after testing)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Optional)
- [ ] Test with production data
- [ ] Add more interactive islands (charts, comparisons)
- [ ] Implement simulation interface
- [ ] Add WebSocket for real-time updates

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Box score details for games
- [ ] Play-by-play data integration
- [ ] Umpire scorecard visualization
- [ ] Team schedule calendar view
- [ ] Player comparison tool
- [ ] Advanced analytics charts
- [ ] Export data functionality
- [ ] User preferences/favorites

---

## Rollback Plan

If needed, to rollback to the old React frontend:

```bash
# 1. Stop current frontend
docker-compose stop frontend

# 2. Update docker-compose.yml
# Change: context: ./frontend-fresh
# To: context: ./frontend-old-react

# 3. Rebuild and start
docker-compose up -d --build frontend
```
